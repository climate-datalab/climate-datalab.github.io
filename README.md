# Climate DataLab

## A Public Resource for Climate Model Education

---------------------------

### Welcome to Climate DataLab!

Learning how to work with datasets from climate models can be a daunting process when getting started, even for those with existing technical expertise. Climate DataLab provides "end-to-end" training on all aspects of the process:
- Understanding the fundamentals of how climate models are set up
- Basics of file formats used for storing climate model output (netCDF)
- Coordinate systems and dealing with 1D vs. 2D latitude and longitude information
- Calendar systems employed by climate models
- Scenarios of future climate change
- Naming schemes for both climate models and model experiments: from scenarios to MIPs
- Climate model large ensembles
- Model "parameterizations" and inter-model physical differences


#### Climate DataLab Goals
The goals of our project are:
- To increase usability of climate model output by the broader environmental science community as well as other interested groups
- To foster learning across demographics historically underrepresented in climate science
